# ðŸ“¸ How to Upload Photos and Videos

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Media
1. **Player Photo**: Take a clear headshot (400x600px recommended)
2. **Action Shots**: Get photos of Jayden playing (catching, running, tackling)
3. **Videos**: Record his best plays (10-30 seconds each)

#### Option A: Using GitHub Website
1. Go to https://github.com/KSLepley/HJL_Football
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Drag your photos to `assets/images/` folder
4. Drag your videos to `assets/videos/highlights/` folder
5. Add commit message: "Add player photos and videos"
6. Click "Commit changes"

#### Option B: Using Terminal (if you have Git)
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /Users/kaylielepley/HJL_PWB

# Add your media files
git add assets/images/player-photo.jpg
git add assets/videos/highlights/touchdown-catch.mp4

# Commit and push
git commit -m "Add player photos and videos"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: File Naming

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Optimization Tips

### Before Uploading:
1. **Compress videos** to under 50MB each
2. **Use MP4 format** for best compatibility
3. **Keep videos short** (10-30 seconds)
4. **Create thumbnails** (poster images) for each video

### Free Tools to Use:
- **HandBrake** (free video compressor)

## ðŸ“± Alternative: YouTube/Vimeo (Recommended for Videos)

For better performance, upload videos to YouTube/Vimeo and embed them:

1. **Upload to YouTube** (unlisted or public)
2. **Get the video ID** from the URL
3. **Replace video tags** in highlights.html with:
```html
<iframe width="100%" height="200" 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" 
        frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```
